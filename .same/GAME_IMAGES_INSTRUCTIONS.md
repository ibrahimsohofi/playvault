## Instructions:

1. Create the following directories if they don't exist:
   - `public/images/games/fifa-24/`
   - `public/images/games/call-of-duty/`
   - `public/images/games/need-for-speed/`

2. For each game, click the download links above and save the images with the specified filenames in their respective directories.

3. After downloading all images, the games will be fully functional on your website with all the images in place.

4. If any image links are broken, you may need to find alternative sources for those images.

5. The games are already added to your `gameData.ts` file, so once the images are in place, they will appear on your website.

Let me know if you need any help with the image downloads or if you'd like me to find alternative image sources!
