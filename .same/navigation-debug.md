# Navigation Issue Debug Analysis

## Problem Description
When navigating from `/categories` back to `/` (home page), the page appears black/blank instead of showing the homepage content.

## Analysis

### Identified Issues in App.tsx

1. **Duplicate Routes** (Lines 84 and 92):
   ```tsx
   <Route path="/categories" element={<GameCategoriesPage />} />
   // Later...
   <Route path="/categories" element={<GameCategoriesPage />} />
   ```
   The duplicate route at line 92 is not wrapped in Suspense, which could cause rendering issues.

2. **Lazy Loading Issue**:
   The HomePage component uses lazy-loaded components that might be failing to load properly on navigation.

3. **Suspense Boundary Issue**:
   The HomePage doesn't have its own Suspense wrapper in the Routes, unlike other pages.

### Potential Fixes

1. **Remove duplicate `/categories` route**
2. **Add proper Suspense wrapper to HomePage route**
3. **Check for theme/context provider issues**
4. **Investigate lazy loading failures**

## Next Steps
1. Fix the duplicate route issue
2. Add proper error boundaries
3. Test navigation between pages
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
